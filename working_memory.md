# Identifying Key Token Buyer Personas for ![LilyPad Tech Logo](lilypad-logo.svg)

## 1. Executive Summary
LilyPad Tech is embarking on a mission to establish an open-access AI innovation economy. The initiative centers around a decentralized network that empowers users to host, execute, and monetize AI models.  
The Token Generation Event (TGE) rolls out in two phases:  
1. Private investors ($10 M FDV)  
2. Public launch via launchpads (or fallback DEX)  

Four key token-buyer personas emerge:  
1. **Speculative Investor (Degen)**  
2. **AI & Web3 Enthusiast**  
3. **Resource Seeker (Builder/Creator)**  
4. **Utility-Focused Investor**

This document details each persona and supplies data-driven messaging frameworks for landing-page creation.
